# 📊 Vivi Kitchen Sales Dashboard

Beyond day-to-day reporting, the Vivi Kitchen Dashboard is a strategic compass for decision-making. By consistently monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), the team can spot opportunities for growth, detect inefficiencies, and respond quickly to market changes.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The Vivi Kitchen Sales Dashboard was created to help the business understand how well its products are selling, how much profit is being made, and which areas or customers are performing best. It turns large amounts of sales data into easy-to-read charts, summaries, and visuals that make it simple to spot trends, compare results, and find what’s working or not. With just a few clicks, team members can explore different parts of the business — like which product sells the most, which country brings in the highest revenue, or which months are busiest for sales.

This dashboard is especially useful for managers, sales teams, and decision-makers who want quick answers without digging through spreadsheets. It helps the business make smarter choices about what to sell, where to focus marketing, and how to improve profits. Whether planning for the next quarter or looking back at last year’s results, the dashboard provides a clear view of the numbers that matter most.
